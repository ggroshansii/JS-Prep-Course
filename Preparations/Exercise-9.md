/*

Which of the following names don't satisfy the style guidelines for naming variables, functions, or constants?

*/


1stCharacter, snake_case, quick_Fox

**Unacceptable names: snake_case and quick_Fox contain underscores; underscores are permitted in constant names, but these aren't constant names since they use lowercase letters. 1stCharacter isn't valid at all: names may not begin with a digit.
