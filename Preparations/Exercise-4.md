1) Use node to run the foo.js file using node. What does it output?
2) Copy and paste the code from foo.js into the node REPL. What does it output?
3) Copy and paste the code from foo.js into the Chrome console REPL. What does it output?

cd preparations_excerises
node foo.js



**The takeaway here is that variations in the output depend on how you run your code. The one feature all three environments have in common is that each logs the value bar to the console. Generally, a REPL has an output for every line of code. The Chrome console does not run the code one line at a time when you paste a multiline code snippet. That's why the output appears different when compared to the node REPL.
